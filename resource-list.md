### CS Fundamentals

- Learn one language inside and out for interviews (eg: Python).
- Stick to learning the basics and skip on the fancy stuff (like list comprehensions) until you feel 100% comfortable with everything else.

**Topics:**

- data structures
- algorithms
- big O notation
- dynamic programming
- string manipulation
- object oriented programming (OOP)
- recursion
- tree traversal

**Possibly optional stuff:**

- graph theory
- design patterns
- combinatorial problems

**Big O Notation:**

- freeCodeCamp.org's free 2 hr lecture video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo4vesaut8g

### System Design

**General:**

- :sparkles: [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer): learn how to design scalable systems
- Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD): [quick reference for relationship symbols](https://www.vivekmchawla.com/erd-crows-foot-relationship-symbols-cheat-sheet/)

**Databases:**

- DB structure & design tutorial: https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/database-diagram/database-design

**Diagram Drawing Tools:**

1. https://www.diagrams.net/

   - This is the tool we used for systems design diagrams yesterday.

2. https://dbdiagram.io/home

   - Very similar to option #3. Use this if you prefer typing up your db schema. Allows you to import/export SQL.

3. https://drawsql.app/home
   - Very similar to option #2. Nice UI and UX, but not easy to type out schema and relationships. Allows you to import/export SQL. Better relationship arrows with directionality.

### Front-End

**Types of Front-End Roles:**

1. Functional JavaScript-related work
   - middleware
   - handling APIs
   - building APIs
2. Visual work
   - DOM structure/optimization
   - CSS & JS interactions
   - may blend with UX/UI design a bit...
