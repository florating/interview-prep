## CS Fundamentals

- Learn one language inside and out for interviews (eg: Python).
- Stick to learning the basics and skip on the fancy stuff (like list comprehensions) until you feel 100% comfortable with everything else.

**Topics:**

- data structures
- algorithms
- big O notation
- dynamic programming
- string manipulation
- object oriented programming (OOP)
- recursion
- tree traversal
- breadth-first search vs depth-first search

**Possibly optional stuff:**

- graph theory
- design patterns
- combinatorial problems

**Algorithms:**

- [The Tech Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/introduction/): [Algorithm tips](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/introduction/#general-tips)

**Big O Notation:**

- freeCodeCamp.org's free 2 hr lecture video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo4vesaut8g

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**What is it?**

- encapsulation

- [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Design_patterns)

More will be added soon.

## Code Quality

- [When to check your code quality](https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/#when-can-i-check-my-code-quality)
    <details><summary>Characteristics of high-quality code</summary>

  _Originally written for Python, but the general tips are true for most or all other languages._

  - It does what it is supposed to do.
  - It does not contain defects or problems.
  - It is easy to read, maintain, and extend.

  _Quoted from Real Python's [article about code quality](https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/#what-is-code-quality)._
    </details>

- keep your code [DRY (don't repeat yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

### Anti-Patterns

**What is it?**
"a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern))

watch out for [antipatterns](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns) in [the code](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/software-development-antipatterns)

### Code Review

<details><summary>What qualities do code reviewers look for?</summary>

- **Design**: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for your system?

- **Functionality**: Does the code behave as the author likely intended? Is the way the code behaves good for its users?
- **Complexity**: Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future?
- **Tests**: Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?
- **Naming**: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.?
- **Comments**: Are the comments clear and useful?
- **Style**: Does the code follow our style guides?
- **Documentation**: Did the developer also update relevant documentation?

## Design Patterns

**What are they?**

- **creational patterns** provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way

<details><summary>Examples of creational design patterns</summary>

<details><summary>from Wikipedia</summary>

- Abstract Factory pattern: a class requests the objects it requires from a factory object instead of creating the objects directly

- Factory method pattern: centralize creation of an object of a specific type choosing one of several implementations
- Builder pattern: separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations
- Dependency Injection pattern: a class accepts the objects it requires from an injector - instead of creating the objects directly
- Lazy initialization pattern: tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed
- Object pool pattern: avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
- Prototype pattern: used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects
- Singleton pattern: restrict instantiation of a class to one object

</details>

<details><summary>from The Interview Study Guide for Software Engineers</summary>

- Factory Design Pattern
- Observer Design Pattern
- Adapter Design Pattern
- Facade Design Pattern
- Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
- Interpreter Design Pattern
- Singleton Design Pattern
- Head First Design Patterns

- **structural patterns** are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality

- **behavioral patterns** are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns

- **concurrency patterns** deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm

## Databases

**Topics:**

- SQL vs NoSQL databases
- ACID compliance (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)
- normalization
- data warehousing
- sanitizing user input (beware of SQL injection attacks!)

**General:**

- DB structure & design tutorial: https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/database-diagram/database-design
- MySQL vs PostgreSQL: https://towardsdatascience.com/mysql-vs-postgresql-3d48891452a


**Diagram Drawing Tools:**

1. https://www.diagrams.net/

   - This is the tool we used for systems design diagrams yesterday.

2. https://dbdiagram.io/home

   - Very similar to option #3. Use this if you prefer typing up your db schema. Allows you to import/export SQL.

3. https://drawsql.app/home
   - Very similar to option #2. Nice UI and UX, but not easy to type out schema and relationships. Allows you to import/export SQL. Better relationship arrows with directionality.
