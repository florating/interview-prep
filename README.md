## Mindset

What are some of the traits that recruiters and hiring managers look for when they are hiring? What are the characteristics of a great software engineer?

1. Build up your self-confidence.
    - Don't let someone underestimate your ability just because you have less experience!
    - Companies are hiring candidates based on their potential to learn and grow. They don't expect you to have 100% of the skills listed in a job posting.
2. Keep learning. :)
3. Take initiative, and get comfortable looking at documentation!

## General Study Plan

This study plan is my personal opinion. Please give me feedback! :)

### Self-Assessment

How prepared do you feel?

1. How prepared do you feel? Take stock of your current skills.
   - Review the list of skills per the [junior web developer checklist](https://different-marmoset-f7b.notion.site/Junior-Web-Developer-Checklist-1-0-13f79e255d75430e97e6e99617cddb74)
2. Keep your goals in mind: what kind of tech role are you hoping for?
   - What kinds of skills do these job postings require?
   - Take a look at [some job postings](#job-applications) and write down key skills to learn.
   - Prioritize skills that are listed most frequently.
3. Test yourself, and then grade your work/knowledge as objectively as you can.
4. Create a daily review sheet (which I will call your _dailies_ from now on).
   - Track your mistakes and why you made those mistakes.
   - It's also great to keep track of knowledge that you _do_ have, to maintain it and prevent it from fading away.
5. Stay focused.
   - Q: Are you hoping to be a full-stack developer? Or more front-end? Or back-end? Or something else?
   - Pick a tech stack that will benefit you most when you interview (eg: Python) or something that is gaining popularity in the tech industry you are targeting.

### Create a Schedule

**Plan**

**Review core areas**

**Practice**

Try using the Pomodoro technique to timeblock undisturbed study time.

More info TBD.

**Example of a Daily Routine:**

- review dailies (10 - 30 min)
- coding challenge (timed! 15 - 45 min)
- break
- review coding challenge (30 - 60 min)
- break
- watch lectures (45-60 min)
- etc.

### Behavioral

The interviewer may ask you to describe a challenge you faced and how you dealt with it. Use the [STAR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) to organize your thoughts about your experience.

<details><summary>What is the STAR format?</summary>

- **Situation**: Describe a recent challenge and situation you were in.
- **Task/Target**: What were you trying to achieve from the situation?
- **Action**: What did you do and why? Were there any alternatives?
- **Results**: What was the outcome of your actions?

</details>

<details><summary>What qualities are interviewers hoping to see based on your answer?</summary>

- **Empathy**: Empathize with both roles and make sure to understand each individuals' reasons
- **Willingness**: Willingness to wear multiple hats
  - eg: Picked up the role of the designer and came up with wireframes
- **Project management**: Able to unblock the project by changing approaches midway to great effectiveness
- **Conflict management**: Explain to parties involved in the conflict and make sure no hard feelings remain
- **Hold people accountable**: Show that you are responsible
  - eg: Get a confirmation date as to when the designer can produce the mockups and hold him accountable

</details>

If you have any time remaining, ask some questions! Be mindful of who your audience is - tailor your question to the interviewer with respect to their experience level and scope.

Here are some example questions:
